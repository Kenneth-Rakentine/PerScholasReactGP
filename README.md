### Description

Atmocast is a lightweight multi-page weather application utilizing Open Meteo to provide accessible weather information on the go. You can enter any city location into the search-bar, and through the use of Open Meteo's intuitive APIs, you can see weather data for that location. This app provides a wide range of data that you may find useful and you can even look at last week's weather as well! You can use the navigation to swap between different datasets.
